Before you do anything else, take a picture of this document with your phone, since you might need it one day. You are now a member of Pawprint Prototyping, Santa Clara's first and only hackerspace. Here's a few resources you should be aware of: https://hass.pawprint.space This is our Home Assistant install. You can view the outside cameras, remotely open the door, see if the lights are on, etc. Just log in with your LDAP credentials. You should probably write down your LDAP account name here: https://ipa.pawprint.space (Internal only!) This is our IPA portal, which you can use to manage your LDAP account. This only works if you're at the space. https://t.me/+06eI4qQVzXJjYzAx This is the link to join our Telegram group, where most of the group discussion happens. (669) 696 7297 You can call this number to ring the phones at the space, in case you want to talk to someone there. Food The \"kitchen\" operates on a take-one-leave-one basis, where the space doesn't contribute directly to any food or supplies, but members volunteer to restock items that they consume. Although there is some limited cooking equipment, the kitchen isn't set up for making meals. If you do get any of the equipment dirty, please wipe it down and wash the things you used in the industrial wash basin in the back of the space. Parking Tickets If you leave any gear at the space, get a yellow parking ticket request form from the office, fill it out, tag the equipment, and message the board on Telegram. They'll attach the appropriate paperwork to the item, including an expiration date. Storing things in the upstairs area generally requires coordination with other people; message the telegram group if you do this, and make sure to fill out a parking ticket request. HVAC There's a Nest thermostat in the kitchen room, near the inner door. Just twist the outer ring of the thermostat to set the desired temperature, and The Cloud will try to accomodate your request. The Wifis Scan the big QR code in the office to get the current access information. The WPA pre-shared key should also be printed on that same QR code. Safety Third! It's assumed that you know what you're doing, so there aren't many safeguards on any of the equipment. Some of it could maim or blind you. If you don't already know you can operate something safely, you can't and you shouldn't. Message the telegram channel for assistance. Maybe you'll make a new friend! Breakers Some of the gear can and will trip circuit breakers when operated in certain combinations. Example: the toaster and the microwave in the kitchen, or the upright router and a table saw on one of the overhead extension cords, and probably others. You can reset the overhead breakers using one of the long sticks in the corner, to the left of the rolling door. Other breakers just need a boop in the right place, look around for a reset button. TV The TV near the conference table has a Chromecast normally connected to its HDMI port, although sometimes it's swapped out for the Chromebox used to run meetings. There's also a VGA cable on the conference table that you can use to hook up your own laptop. Speakers The sound system can be driven by any bluetooth client, just go to the office and hit the PAIRING button on the remote for the Sony amplifier, then pair your device like usual. There's also a Chrome streaming device hooked up to the AUX port, and you can stream to that over the network if you set the amp to the AUX input. Try not to blast audio too loudly. Cat There's some cats that live in the parking lot. The neighbors feed them. Don't bother trying to make friends with them, they don't like humans getting too close. HAZMAT (there should be something from the board here) PPE There's personal protective equipment (PPE) such as goggles and earmuffs in the large upright cabinet in the office. You should use them, and offer them to others present, if you're going to be using any of the power tools in the front of the space.","title":"Welcome!"},{"location":"welcome/#welcome","text":"Before you do anything else, take a picture of this document with your phone, since you might need it one day.

Our Chinese laser, manufactured by Omtech, features: 80W output 600 \u00d7 900 mm (24\" \u00d7 35\") working surface A Ruida controller Rotary axis attachment needs replacing Safety and Certification Protective Equipment Safety glasses : Polycarbonate, acrylic, or any prescription glasses will offer protection from IR light. Water spray bottle : to put out small fires. Hazards Laser-cutting presents a risk of fire and burns. Laser-cutting certain materials can release gases that are harmful to humans and may damage the machine. The laser emits invisible infrared radiation that can damage your eyes. The laser is powered by high-voltage, and presents an electrocution risk if the cabinet is open. Prohibited Operations Modifying or hacking the laser cutter and its accessories without board approval. Bypassing interlocks or safety features. Cutting materials that may harm humans or equipment. Prohibited materials The following materials should NEVER be placed into the laser cutter. Material Reason polycarbonate Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas vinyl Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas PVC Melts instead of burns, releases chlorine gas Neoprene Sublimated vapors damage the optics Moleskin notebooks Contains chlorine, releases poison gas ABS Burning ABS releases hydrogen cyanide gas self-laminated or glued Anything you laminated yourself or glued together is a fire hazard low-grade plywood Excessive bowing can cause the gantry to catch on the wood being cut Pre-flight checklist Before every use Make sure that the machine and workspace are clutter-free. The laser cutter is not a table . Have a plan for putting out small fires without causing damage to the machine. A small spray bottle of tap water or rag for smothering is usually fine for this purpose. Verify a fire extinguisher is easily accessible in case things go wrong. Check that the auxiliary systems (chiller, air and exhaust) are properly connected and functional. The Air pump is internal to the machine, and controlled by software. The chiller and exhaust impeller should be plugged directly into the laser cutter, and should turn on when the machine is running. Operation checklist Operational Safety Ensure material to be cut is safe to use. See Consumable Material Reference for details. Never leave a laser cutter unattended when running a job Take care to select appropriate power/speeds settings to avoid combustion. Always start jobs with lowest power if unsure. Basic Operation Checklist Select an appropriate power and speed for the material you are cutting. Here are some good starting guidelines for various materials below. Some materials are highly variable, especially wood. Do some test cuts and engraves to dial in the right settings. More feeds and speeds can be found here Max power level The manufacturer does not recommend surpassing 70% power for any project. You should get desired cuts or engraving quality with no more than 50-60% max power. Running above 70% max power constantly will shorten the lifespan of the laser tube.

Place the material under the Z-axis sensor, press Fn , and use the up/down arrow to highlight Auto Focus setting, and press Enter to set the Z-height. This will place the focus exactly at the top of the material, and set the machine Z-height to 0. Use this setting for engraving. For cutting, especially thick material, you will need to adjust the Z-height to the center of the material. However since the auto-focus sets the height of the bed to the surface, and won't let you back-drive the bed to Z < 0, you will need to place another piece of material of the same thickness before using the auto-focus, and then back-drive the bed down (3/2) \u00d7 (material thickness). Post-flight checklist End of operation and clean-up Power down the machine Wipe surfaces Clean debris from inside as needed with shop vac.

This machine is capable of precisely machining most common metals, although it excels in brass and aluminum. Safety and Certification Protective Equipment Safety glasses : Proper safety glasses are required at all times. Ear protection : May occasionally be needed for particularly screechy operations. Respirator : Recommended if using large amounts of cutting oil. DO NOT WEAR GLOVES : They can get caught in the lathe causing serious injury. Hazards High-torque device : Lathes, even small ones, can easily remove fingers. Keep hands away from moving parts. Do NOT wear gloves during operation, as they can get caught in the lathe. No dangly bits : Long sleeves, long hair, loose clothing and jewelry can easily get caught in the lathe causing serious injury. Long hair must be tied up. Sharp chips : Metal shavings are razor sharp and very hot. Use gloves when cleaning them up (but NOT while the lathe is running) Remove the chuck key from the chuck when not actively using it . Turning on the lathe while the chuck key is inserted will fling it directly into your face at high velocity. Metal parts will likely be hot immediately after turning. Let them cool down. Files must have a proper handle. If the lathe shoves the file back towards you, the tang of a file will cut right through your hand. Prohibited Operations Modifying or hacking the lathe and its accessories without board approval. Bypassing interlocks or safety features. Cutting materials that may harm humans or equipment. When cutting stringy materials like aluminum or Delrin, DO NOT try to clear the chips while the lathe is running. Turn the lathe off, clear the chips with pliers, then resume the operation. Do not use a parting blade while the live or dead center is in use. The center will cause the work to pinch the blade, likely shattering it. If using abrasives (i.e. emery cloth for polishing), the ways must remain covered with a towel. Abrasive grit damages the ways over time. If turning wood, the ways must also be covered. Sawdust mixes with oil and turns into a sludge that gums up the machine. Disclaimer Machining has a steep learning curve. This page is not a substitute for proper learning materials. Materials While this is a metal lathe, some metals are vastly more difficult to work with than others. We strongly recommend starting with brass when first learning, as it cuts easily and forms good chips. Aluminum cuts similarly easily, but leaves a rats nest of ribbons behind. This lathe can cut mild steel but requires a very light depth of cut, slow feed rate and lots of cutting oil. A free machining steel such as 12L14 will make life a bit easier. Pre-flight checklist Before every use Ensure the chuck key is not in the chuck. Ensure the chuck has a secure grip on the work. Ensure the tool post is fastened. Ensure the machine is well oiled. Disengage the half nut. Operation checklist During use Be constantly mindful of the position of the tool and carriage. Constantly check to make sure you aren't in danger of crashing the lathe. Start with a very light cut and a slow feed. Post-flight checklist End of operation and clean-up Clean up the work area. Metal chips are sharp and should only be handled with gloves. Cover up the lathe when done. Certified Members Member Name Certified By Date Bobby Tables Bucko 2020-01-01 Maintenance Unplug the lathe before performing any maintenance. If removing the chuck, put a wooden board on the ways underneath it in case you drop the chuck.
